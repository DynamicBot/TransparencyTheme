## Installing Theme

Just download the config file and you're good to go.

## Themes/Support/Suggestions

Make sure to have Dark mode and BetterDiscord Blue enabled to make sure all things work correctly. These can be found under "Core" under BetterDiscord / BandagedBD settings.

If you find a problem or would like to give feedback/suggestions or need support with my themes or CSS in general feel free to send a direct message to me in discord Twiistrz#8016.
