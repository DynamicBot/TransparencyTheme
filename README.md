Shoutout to all the boys in #css-and-themes in BD2 for all the help they've given. 

Use the TRANSPARENCYCONFIG.THEME.CSS do not use TRANSPARENCYMASTER.CSS. Just download the [TransparencyConfig](https://github.com/Twiistrz/BetterDiscordThemeMasterFile/tree/master/CONFIG) file in CONFIG folder and you're good to go.
